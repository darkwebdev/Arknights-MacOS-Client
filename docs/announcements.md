# Announcements

The launcher can fetch occasional project messages from the repository without a separate server. The feed lives in [`announcements.json`](../announcements.json) on `main` and is read once when the launcher starts. Users can disable these checks in Settings.

Each announcement is shown once per installation. Changing its text does not show it again; use a new `id` when a follow-up message should be presented. See [Architecture § Launcher communication](architecture.md#launcher-communication) for exactly how announcements are fetched, filtered, and queued alongside launcher updates and Yostar's own in-game notices.

## Previewing a popup

Run the isolated debug simulator, open Settings → Developer, pick "Custom popup" from the Scenario menu, type the message as Markdown, and press Show Popup to see it rendered in the real popup modal:

```sh
just preview
```

The preview uses separate temporary paths and preferences. Its game controls never start, update, or remove the real installation. Every other simulated state (launcher update, announcement, downloading, and so on) is available from the same Scenario menu.

## Publishing

Prepare a feed entry with:

```sh
just announcement set \
	feedback-2026-08 \
	"Help improve Arknights Client" \
	/tmp/feedback.md \
	"Open GitHub Issues" \
	https://github.com/LuMiSxh/Arknights-MacOS-Client/issues
```

Review the resulting `announcements.json`, commit it to `main`, and push. Removing an entry prevents installations that have not fetched it yet from seeing it:

```sh
just announcement remove feedback-2026-08
```

Publishing and removing announcements require repository write access. GitHub may briefly cache the contents response, so changes are not guaranteed to reach every client immediately.
